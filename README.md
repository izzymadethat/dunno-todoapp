# Dunno ToDo App

In my latest installment of a to-do app, I am using Nextjs for the features it adds to React. From build to deploy, I found that it is very easy (easier than just react) to use Nextjs.

## Instructions

Simply visit [Dunno](https://dunno-todoapp.vercel.app/). Enter your task and when completed click to check it off.
